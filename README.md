# dotfiles

My dotfiles and scripts for bootstrapping a new computer! I use macOS and fish, among other tools. There are things in this repo that won't apply to most people, but the layout of this repository is quite simple and you can easily add or remove anything as you see fit.

Installation:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:alex-grover/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  ./setup.sh
```
