# dotfiles

My dotfiles and scripts for bootstrapping a new computer! I use macOS and fish, among other tools. There are things in this repo that won't apply to most people, but the layout of this repository is quite simple and you can easily add or remove anything as you see fit.

Installation:

```bash
xcode-select --install
mkdir ~/Developer
cd ~/Developer
# Add SSH key to GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
git clone git@github.com:alex-grover/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
